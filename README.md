# Sorting & Searching Algorithms in C++

This C++ program demonstrates classic **sorting and searching algorithms**—including **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Binary Search**—in a simple **menu-driven application**. It allows users to input an array, choose a sorting method, and then search for an element using Binary Search.

## 📌 Features

- 📥 User-defined input array
- 🔀 Sorting Options:
  - Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)
  - Quick Sort (Efficient, In-Place Sorting)
- 🔎 Binary Search (on the sorted array)
- 🧾 Array Display Before and After Sorting
- 🧠 Simple CLI-based Menu System

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL): `vector`
- Basic I/O via `iostream`
